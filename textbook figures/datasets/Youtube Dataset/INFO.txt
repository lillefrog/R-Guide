To study the growth trend of the video popularity, we also updated the statistics of some previously found videos. For this crawl we only retrieve the number of views for relatively new videos (uploaded after February 15th, 2007). This crawl is performed once a week from March 5th to April 16th 2007, which results in seven datasets. The current dataset was the first one retrived.
