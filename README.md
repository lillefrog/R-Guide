# R-Guide

Collection of R code and scripts for data analysis and visualization

This is meant as a resource for new users of R so make sure that your code is easy to use and clearly explained.

1.  Make a comment in the beginning that explains what the code is expected to do.

2.  The code should work without any setup, so include a data sample if necessary.

3.  Keep the scripts short and clear, one script should mostly be made to do one analysis or make one figure.

4.  Do not use more libraries than necessary and especially do not use any that require special care when installing.
